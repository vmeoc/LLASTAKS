## Goal of this stage
Bring visibility on the following layers through metrics, logs, trace:
- Kubernetes: CLuster, nodes, pods: what are the resources consumption and health
- service layer: what are the key metrics for the various services: Token generation latency for vLLM, number of chunk served for FAISS, number of calls from the orchestrator
- application layer: number of requests & total latency for the chatbot-rag, end to end traceability
